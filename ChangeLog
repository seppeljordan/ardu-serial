	* libarduserial/arduserial.c (ser_readln): fixed a bug where the program
	did not expect a cariage return, expexted new line. improved performance
	slightly.
	* testsuite/arduserial/testreadln.c (main): translated a debug message
	into english. Added a check for the length of the read string. Check
	for nul termination of the read string. added a constant to store the
	the message the arduino sends.

	* testsuite/testdef.h: created a header file to include for testing, like
	return codes and the path to the arduino connected.
	* testsuite/arduserial/Makefile.am: should work correctly now and build
	the testprograms
	* testsuite/arduserial/testflush.c: uses now a fixed size string
	to read the message from the board and includes testdef.h
	* testsuite/arduserial/testreadln.c: includes now testdef.h.  added
	some more verbose output for debugging purposes.

	* .gitignore: added the executables of the tests to .gitignore
	* testsuite/arduserial/testreadln.c (main): implemented a test for
	readln but it is not working (memory access violation)
	* testsuite/arduserial/testinit.c: implemented a test for ser_init 
	function that makes tests for an error when accessing a non existant
	serial connection
	* testsuite/arduserial/testflush.c (main): implemented a test for
	ser_flush function. Does not work right now (memory access violation)

	* autotools: removed the files that were generated automatically
	from the version control

	* arduserial.c: slight changes to the initialization process
	prints more error messages when the library does system calls that fail
